## About Me

Rabid Curiosity is where I put the threads I’m tugging on—technology, work, habits, systems, the things that break, the things that work, and the questions that sit in the back of my head for too long.

Professionally, I spend my days in the world of IT infrastructure and service management. I’ve spent a decade in the small-business tech ecosystem: building processes, taming networks, fixing what shouldn’t have broken, and trying to make systems and teams behave predictably in environments that rarely are. I enjoy the parts of IT that aren’t about gear or configuration but about how people operate around those systems: incentives, communication, expectations, and the difference between what we say we do and what we actually do.

Outside of work, the same impulse applies. I like understanding why things function the way they do—organizations, tools, habits, even the patterns in my own thinking. I’ve been an ultrarunner, which means I’ve learned more about slow progress, limits, and stubbornness than I ever expected. These days I’m getting back into running, mostly because it’s a clean way to test ideas about consistency and process.

This blog isn’t meant to be a brand or a polished portfolio. It’s a place to think in public. Sometimes that’ll involve technical deep dives, sometimes work and management philosophy, and sometimes the smaller—but usually more revealing—questions about how we live, what we value, and why certain ideas won’t leave us alone.

If there’s any unifying theme here, it’s this: I’m trying to understand the systems that shape my life, break them down a bit, and rebuild them in ways that make more sense. Writing helps me do that. Hopefully reading some of it helps you do the same.
