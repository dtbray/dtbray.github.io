title: "A New Year"

Back in May of last year, I thought I might locate the headspace to start writing down thoughts, ideas, and inspirations.  Obviously, that's not quite the case.  In those seven months, I've had serveral huge positive changes - a new apartment with my long-term partner, a thrilling job with enormous upward potential for growth, and reading nearly 60 books in the latter half of the year.

I've always been a knowledge sponge, and now that I'm fully immersed in the world of IT consulting, there are far more competancies to learn than any one professional could feasibly attain.  2019 is my year of working smarter, not harder.

There will likely be some changes to this site in the next days and weeks as I make decisions on what to write.

See you there!

Best,

Thomas
