To new beginnings!  With graduate school finished, I finally have the time to focus on the things that will matter in my life.  This, of course, is merely an indulgence.

What can you expect from this?  I'll have to get back to you on that.  I imagine I'll write about anything that captures my interest and deserves a post - book reviews, quick IT bites, productivity tips, intellectual musings, and other questionably-useful information.

See you there!
