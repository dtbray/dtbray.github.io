title: "...Is this thing on?"
---

This is a new thing to me - working from a Linux VM on one monitor while checking the repo on my other monitor.  Of course, it's down at the moment, and I'm not quite sure why.

You're probably curious.  What is this?  To be honest, I'm really not sure yet.  I do know that it's altogether _too_ complicated for me to even begin to explain; that's a task for another day.  You could say that it's Agile blogging, but that's an insult to Agile.


...Except, well, the above didn't work.  Here I am, back in Windows, working from Visual Studio Code to write this.  Much simpler this way.

Anyway, welcome to the blog!  Now, if I could only figure out how to put the proper header in there...
